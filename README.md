# To Execute
1. run ```api.py```
2. open the url that it gives you after you run the code
3. Tada!! the web app will open!

Still confused as to how to run?<br>
Well, then open your terminal,<br>
```
cd <path/to/your/project>
$python api.py<br>
```
it will give a link to open<br>
click and the web app will be open in your Web browser.
